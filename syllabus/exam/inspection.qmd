After the exams have been graded, you will have the opportunity to attend the exam inspection. The goals of this inspection are for you to (a) understand how your exam has been graded (i.e., per question), (b) learn from viewing an answer key to a particular question, and (c) verify the answer key has been applied consistently.

The date of the exam inspection will be communicated via Canvas. The review typically takes place in a computer lab room on campus.

You can review the grading of each question by clicking on the question number.

Note that written feedback may not be available for all questions. In that case, compare your answer to the response model/answer key.

### 3) Ask questions

Would you like to ask how the answer key was applied in your case? Ask the course coordinator!

### 4) File a written request for review

Any unresolved questions? Then __file a request for review__.

- Do so for each question by entering a comment in the designated comment box on TestVision, which is located below each question.

- When adding a request for review, please __briefly__ argue why you believe you deserve (more) points for the specific question. In your request, refer as much as possible to the answer key.
