The exam for this course is a **120-minute on-campus computer exam** (course code 328059-M-6), taken in [TestVision](https://TilburgU.testvision.nl/online/kandidaten). It is a __closed-book exam with no internet access__, though students may download selected cheat sheets from the exam’s introduction page. 

<!--
Students taking the discontinued 3 ECTS version should prepare using the exam material from the previous semester.
-->

Key points to keep in mind:

* four exam dates are offered each academic year, of which students may take part in at most two.
* only the official exam “cheatsheets” are permitted; no other resources or communication tools are allowed.
* communication with others about the exam is strictly forbidden.
* do not include your name or student number in submitted files unless explicitly asked, to ensure anonymous grading.

## Exam Format

The exam consists of a mix of **open questions** (requiring open-text answers or file uploads) and **closed questions** (such as multiple-choice, ranking, or matching). These questions are organized according to the **learning goals of the course**, and the content for each learning goal will be drawn from both the **tutorials** and the **course book[^2]**.

The exam is worth a total of **120 points**, corresponding to roughly one point per minute of work. This design should help you pace yourself and prioritize your effort during the exam.

In terms of cognitive skills, the exam does not stop at testing factual recall. Instead, it follows **Bloom’s taxonomy of learning objectives**, which means you will be assessed across different levels of thinking:

* **Knowledge & Comprehension** – recalling key concepts and demonstrating understanding of methods and ideas.
* **Application** – using techniques or code you have learned in tutorials and lectures to solve new problems.
* **Analysis** – breaking down complex tasks (e.g., a dataset or research workflow) into their component parts and reasoning about them.
* **Synthesis** – combining different elements (e.g., data, code, and interpretation) to produce a coherent result.
* **Evaluation** – critically judging the suitability of an approach or comparing alternative solutions.

Together, these levels ensure that the exam does not merely check whether you *remember* material, but also whether you can *apply, integrate, and evaluate* it in realistic scenarios.
