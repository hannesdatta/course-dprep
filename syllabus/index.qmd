# Syllabus

## Course Description

Marketing analytics projects — whether for a thesis, a research study, or an analytics role — often involve messy, multi-source datasets, complex analyses, and the need for reproducibility. Small ad-hoc fixes might work for simple tasks, but they quickly break down in these larger, more demanding settings. Today’s datasets (e.g., scraped from the Internet)[^1] and advanced analytics (e.g., requiring high-performance computing) demand a structured, professional way of working.

This course introduces three core principles to help you manage your marketing analytics projects efficiently:

1. **Code** – Build strong coding skills in R/RStudio.
2. **Collaborate** – Work effectively with others using Git/GitHub.
3. **Automate** – Create end-to-end, reproducible research pipelines.

These principles — *code, collaborate, automate* — are applied across the full research workflow: data exploration, preparation, analysis, and reporting. You’ll also learn how to engineer datasets from complex raw sources and share your findings in innovative formats, such as Markdown documents or interactive apps.

### Learning goals

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Use GitHub (or similar tools) for managing empirical research projects (e.g., Issues and Project Boards)
-   Use Git/GitHub (or similar tools) for versioning files and collaborating on privately-shared and publicly-available (open science) code repositories
-   Use R to clean and transform data for analysis (e.g., aggregation, merging, de-duplication, reshaping, data conversions, regular expressions)
-   Use R for generating automatic reports (e.g., to assess data quality, to report research findings in a paper) and deploying research findings in novel ways (e.g., apps)
-   Use Workflow Management Tools to create and run portable, automated, and reproducible data pipelines

### Positioning of the course in the study program

The course is instructed to MSc students in the **Marketing Analytics (TiSEM)** program. Seats are also offered to interested Research Master and PhD students.

This course zooms in on ways to professionalize working on empirical research projects. Rather than focusing on one particular aspect of the research workflow (like collecting data or only conducting an analysis), this course *connects* all components of the research workflow. Along the way, students learn how to write better code (in R, especially concerning preparing complex data for analysis), collaborate in teams (using GitHub), and automate their research workflows (using the automation tool `make`).

Students are recommended to follow this course before embarking on thesis projects. Research Master and Ph.D. students are advised to take this course early on, as it will likely provide them with many tools that will help them conduct their research efficiently.

## Prerequisites

-   The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program.
-   Preparation material is available, and students need to have acquired working knowledge in R before the start of the course. Novices may further benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which R is used.
-   Students can use their own computer for the duration of this course (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Android/Chromebook/iOS devices are not supported. We recommend laptop with 16 GB+ of RAM as we work with larger data sets requiring preprocessing capacity. The exam is held on campus, using Windows computers. Mac and Linux users are advised to practice on the on-campus computers before the exam.

## Teaching format

-   Blended (a mix of online/offline lectures and tutorials, and online/offline coaching sessions)
-   Combination of self-paced tutorials (e.g., using R Notebooks or pre-recorded clips), and interactive live streams for feedback and coaching
-   Learn state-of-the-art tools popular among scientists, marketing analysts, and data scientists (e.g., R, GitHub, `make`)
-   Open education & open science (all material is open; publicly accessible course page that stays with you, even after the end of the course)

## Assessment

-   Team project (40%, out of which 8% are based on students' individual contribution, measured by self- and peer assessment. <!--](/docs/project/grading))-->
-   Computer exam (60%, 120 minutes)

<!--The specification matrix for this course can be [downloaded here](../specification_tables_dprep.pdf). This matrix gives an overview of all the learning goals and their weights in each graded component of the course (i.e., in the final exam, team project and Pulse). -->

```{=html}
<!--
[^2]: Students use a web app to monitor their progress on the course's learning goals by "ticking off" items from a to-do list (e.g., "I have installed Python," "I have finished Tutorial X," etc.). The instructor can use the app to learn which topics to highlight during live streams. Students, in turn, can use the app to see how far others in the class have already proceeded, giving them direct feedback on their performance.

[^3]: In particular, students regularly monitor their progress on the course's learning goals. At least one evaluation per course week is required to obtain points on this component of the course grade.

```

### Passing requirements

Students pass this course if 

- the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the following two components: (1) the group project, and (2) the exam; weights indicated above) is ≥ 5.5, and 
- the exam grade is higher than or equal to 5.0 (≥ 5.0).

Final course grades are rounded to multiples of half points (e.g., 6, 6.5, 7, etc.).

### Resit policy

-   If students have a grade lower than 5.0 on the exam, they cannot pass this course.
    -   Required action: Students will have to take the exam resit.
-   If students are not part of a team, they cannot obtain a grade for the team project and hence cannot pass this course.
    -   Required action: Re-enroll in this course's next edition, and ensure you are part of a team.
-   If students have an exam grade higher or equal to 5.0 but fail the team project (after SPA correction), their total course grade may be lower than 5.5, and hence students fail this course.
    -   Required action: Correct team project based on the course coordinator's grading report, and hand it in again within two weeks after publication of the final grades in this course (submission on Canvas). Only students who fail the team project can have their projects re-graded.
-   Students who have passed the course, but wish to retake the exam, can take the exam resit. The last exam grade counts. Grades for the team project are retained. In other words, the resit exam still counts for 60% of the final course grade.
-   Students who fail the exam and wish to re-take the course in the subsequent semester can *retain* their assignment grades. <!-- upon approval of the course coordinator (grades remain valid for the *next* edition of the course).-->

### Bonus points

The course is designed as an open education course, with all of its source code publicly available at [the course's GitHub repository](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep). Students can earn bonus points for contributing to the course in the form of source code (e.g., to provide solutions for assignments, to write a tutorial for a new package, for debugging code, for maintaining the course's issue board, etc.). Some contributions may also qualify for publication at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com) (see also [here](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website) for the platform's GitHub repository).

Bonus points are awareded to motivate students and reward excellence (e.g., students showing a performance exceeding the normally expected learning outcomes of the course). The award of bonus points can only lead to a mark-up of a sufficient grade, not of an insufficient grade. Moreover, the mark-up is not higher than 0.5 points and is only be awarded once at the level of the final grade. 

Each award of a bonus point is accompanied by an individualized argumentation (i.e. for each student). The award of bonus points is used sparsingly.
