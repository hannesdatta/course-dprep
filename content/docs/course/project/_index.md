# Team Project

## Motivation

Throughout the course, we have touched upon various phases of the data preparation and workflow management pipeline. In the team project, we bring together all that you have learnt.

Together with your team members, you will
- set up a reproducible workflow on GitHub,
- apply the end-to-end Git workflow for versioning files, and manage your project using GitHub Issues, and
- build and automate a data preparation and analysis pipeline from scratch.

Working on your team project is not only a great refresher on the course content, but *especially* gives you a better sense of the added value of using Git/GitHub when collaborating with one another, and automation with `make` with a many source code files.

In addition, the [building blocks on this site](docs/building-blocks) and [at Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com) provide code snippets for more advanced functionalities you may want to incorporate in your team project.

## Learning Goals

After completion of the project, students and researchers need to be equipped with the practical skills to manage the data preparation for a complex, data-intensive research project independently.

## Teams

- Students work in groups
  - 4-5 students per team
  - Allocation in the first course week
<!--
- Three types of teams
  - __(1) Regular teams__ (by default) work with data from [AirBnB](airbnb.md)
  - __(2) Students that are taking ["Online Data Collection and Management" (oDCM)](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com)__ can use the collected raw data from that course.
      - The submission (one for each course) consist of
          - your data collection, the raw data, and its documentation (focus of oDCM), and
          - the entire project pipeline (focus of dPrep, consisting of data exploration, data preparation, automation and deployment).
      - Start your workflow from the data package template.
      - Make sure that you have collected (at least) some raw data by week 5/6 in oDCM, so that you can start your team project here in dPrep.
  - __(3) (External) PhD and research master students__ auditing this course can work on their own research projects.
-->

## Coaching

Students can meet the course instructor for feedback during the scheduled coaching sessions (see [schedule](docs/course/schedule)).

- Attendance is not mandatory but strongly encouraged.
- Sign-up options will be shown on Canvas.
- The meetings will be recorded, and shared with other students.
- We will make use of [TeamViewer](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/teamviewer). Please install it and be prepared to share your ID and temporary password.

## Deadline & Submission
- Deadline: {{< param "Course_Deadline_Project" >}}
<!--Originally 26 March 2021, 6pm; extended to 2 April 2021, 6pm.-->
- Please submit links to your GitHub repository with the necessary source code (one link per team).

{{< hint info>}}
__Where do I submit my report?__

Gotcha! There is no report! The project should self-document itself (e.g., comments in code, `makefile`), plus you'll have an amazing README that ties everything together and motivates your project. Make this one shine! :)

Note that we will check out the state of the repository __at the deadline date and time__, so any changes you make to the repository *afterwards* are not considered for grading.

<!--
You can sign up for optional team meetings with the course instructor in weeks 6-8 to gather feedback on your project. Details on how to register for a time slot will be provided to you at a later stage.
