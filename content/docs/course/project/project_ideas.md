# Project ideas

Here's a list with a couple of project ideas. __Don't feel restricted by these options, though!__ There are plenty of other great ideas and we encourage you to think of applications in which you use combine data from a variety of sources. These datasets are listed on Kaggle which is a data science community that shares tools and resources (e.g., datasets), and in which members enter competitions to solve machine learning challenges. Kagglers are encouraged to share their analysis of datasets with others to get points and receive badges. Therefore, you may want to take a look at the "Discussion" tab on Kaggle to get some inspiration on what you could potentially derive from the data source.
