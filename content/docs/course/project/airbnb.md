# AirBnB data

## Kick-starting the team project

If you are a "regular" team (i.e., you do not have data from your PhD work, nor have you collected data in "Online Data Collection and Management"), you use the *AirBnB data* described below to work on your project.

## Inside AirBnB

The team project draws on datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how Airbnb is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.

This data set allows for a variety of research questions such as:
- How did the Airbnb market in Amsterdam respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of bookings per neighborhood?
- What percentage of hosts violates the 30 day per year [rule](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/860/amsterdam) imposed by the municipality of Amsterdam? What characterizes these accounts?
- How did the Airbnb market expand geographically? Which neighborhoods are upcoming, and which ones have been popular from the start?
- Do professional hosts (i.e., accounts with multiple listings) charge higher prices on average? What is their estimated income per month?
- What are the most popular cities Airbnb cities across Europe? Are those cities also the most expensive cities? Where can you go on vacation and get *good value for money*?
- How do market prices respond to changes in supply and demand? What's the typical price mark-up during the holiday periods?
