# Team Project

## Learning Goals

Throughout the course, we have touched upon various phases of the data preparation and workflow management pipeline. In the team project, we bring together all that you have learnt.

Together with your team members, you will
- set up a reproducible workflow on GitHub,
- apply the end-to-end Git workflow for versioning files, and manage your project using GitHub Issues, and
- build and automate a data preparation and analysis pipeline from scratch.

Working on your team project is not only a great refresher on the course content, but *especially* gives you a better sense of the added value of using Git/GitHub when collaborating with one another, and automation with `make` with a many source code files.


For inspiration, explore past team projects like [Airbnb Price Calculator](https://github.com/course-dprep/airbnb-price-calculator), [COVID-19 and Length of Stay](https://github.com/course-dprep/covid19_on_length_of_stay-team1), and [Movie Genre IMDb Analysis](https://github.com/course-dprep/MovieGenre_IMDbAnalysis). Use these as a starting point, keeping in mind that grading criteria may have changed and these examples are not flawless.

{{< hint info >}}

This project may be *different* from other projects that you have worked on during your study. In particular, the purpose of this project is *not to write an academic research paper*, but instead to focus on the *infrastructure* of working on an academic research paper. More more insights, [check the grading guidelines](grading).

## Getting started

{{<section>}}


<!--
## Deliverables

The deliverable of the team project is an *end-to-end, fully automized workflow*:
- it should download the (raw) data directly from its source,
- explore the raw data files with RMarkdown documents rendered as PDF or HTML files,
- transform and reshape the data into the right format, and
- address a research question and/or business problem using some of the building blocks (e.g., regression, apps, "deployment").

Check out [the detailed grading guidelines here](grading_details.md).

## Organization

### Coaching sessions

During the course, you will have the opportunity to meet up with the course instructor for coaching sessions. These sessions are meant for you to receive feedback on your ideas and code. Frequently, this also entails problem-solving & debugging.

Teams participating in coaching sessions attend the entire session. They typically work together on the team project, and the course instructor will "walk around" to address students' questions. When on Zoom, breakout rooms will be created. There will be approximately 10 minutes per team in total; some teams may prefer to use the entire time at once, while other teams may prefer to ask multiple, short questions over the entire duration of the session.

__Deliverables:__ Most coaching sessions will help the team work on some deliverables, which are always due at the end of a course week and are submitted on Canvas by Friday, 7 pm.

### Team composition

- 4-5 students per team
- Allocation in the first course week
- Enroll your team to the template repository from GitHub classroom (https://classroom.github.com/a/K4FxS25n)


### Deadline & submission
- The submitted repository on Github classroom is the team project that will be graded.
- Deadline: {{< param "Course_Deadline_Project" >}}
<!--Originally 26 March 2021, 6pm; extended to 2 April 2021, 6pm.-->



<!--
- Three types of teams
  - __(1) Regular teams__ (by default) work with data from [AirBnB](airbnb.md)
  - __(2) Students that are taking ["Online Data Collection and Management" (oDCM)](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com)__ can use the collected raw data from that course.
      - The submission (one for each course) consist of
          - your data collection, the raw data, and its documentation (focus of oDCM), and
          - the entire project pipeline (focus of dPrep, consisting of data exploration, data preparation, automation and deployment).
      - Start your workflow from the data package template.
      - Make sure that you have collected (at least) some raw data by week 5/6 in oDCM, so that you can start your team project here in dPrep.
  - __(3) (External) PhD and research master students__ auditing this course can work on their own research projects.

{{< hint info>}}
__Where do I submit my report?__

Gotcha! There is no report! The project should self-document itself (e.g., comments in code, `makefile`), plus you'll have an amazing README that ties everything together and motivates your project. Make this one shine! :)

Note that we will check out the state of the repository __at the deadline date and time__, so any changes you make to the repository *afterwards* are not considered for grading.

<!--
You can sign up for optional team meetings with the course instructor in weeks 6-8 to gather feedback on your project. Details on how to register for a time slot will be provided to you at a later stage.
