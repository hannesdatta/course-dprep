# Data

You have the choice between two datasets: IMDb (or AirBnB.

## Dataset 1: IMDb

### About

[IMDb (Internet Movie Database)](https://imdb.com) is a go-to online platform for information about movies, TV shows, actors, directors, and more. It offers details like titles, release dates, cast info, ratings, and reviews, making it a popular resource for entertainment enthusiasts and professionals.
Subsets of IMDb data can be accessed for personal/non-commercial purposes.

The IMDb data can allow you to answer a variety of research questions, such as:

- How have trends in genre popularity evolved over time in the entertainment industry?
- Is there a connection between the format of a title (movie, TV series, etc.) and its audience reception?
- Does the involvement of specific creators (directors, writers) impact the success of their projects?
- Is an individual's fame related to his/her birth year?
- Are there patterns in viewer engagement with TV series episodes based on release timing?
- Are there differences in audience engagement between content targeted at adults and non-adults?
- Is there a connection between audience ratings and the financial performance of titles?

## Dataset 2: AirBnB

### About

[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) is an independent, open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how Airbnb is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.

This data set allows for a variety of research questions, such as:
- How does the presence of specific neighborhood amenities impact the pricing of Airbnb listings in different cities?
- Do properties with a higher number of positive reviews command a price premium, and does this relationship differ across neighborhoods?
- Can the availability of Airbnb listings be predicted based on historical booking patterns, seasonal trends, and local events?
- What are the key factors influencing the popularity of certain neighborhoods for Airbnb stays, as indicated by booking frequency and review sentiment?
- To what extent do superhosts outperform regular hosts in terms of occupancy rates and pricing adjustments, and is this consistent across different city markets?
- How do different types of property amenities (e.g., pool, gym, balcony) impact occupancy rates and nightly prices across diverse neighborhoods?
- Does the presence of local events, such as concerts or festivals, influence the pricing strategy of Airbnb hosts in proximity to those events?
- Can machine learning models accurately predict the popularity of newly listed Airbnb properties based on their features and neighborhood characteristics?

### Download the data

The data is available per city (e.g., Amsterdam) and entity (e.g., listings, calendar, reviews, neighbourhoods, etc.).
