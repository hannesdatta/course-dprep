# 1. Projects from previous editions
To give you an idea of what a good project could look like, some of the repositories of previous course editions are shared through the [dprep course organization](https://github.com/course-dprep) on GitHub! Feel free to check these out and get inspired by them for your own team project!

# 2. Recommended Readings

* [Information for data and code replication packages](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information.html)
* [Verification Guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html)
* [Data and Code Policy of the American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)
* [Guide for collaboration at The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/collaboration.html)

Also check out the [cheatsheets](../cheat-sheets) for relevant information to use in your team project (e.g., rendering rmd files in make, using Shiny apps, Git commans and more!)

# 3. Examples

Curious to see what you can build after following this course? Or looking for some ideas how to structure the directory structure of your team project?

Here, we provide some inspiration, based on the creative and/or reproducible work of others!
