# Workplan and Coaching

You’ll start working on your project -- an *end-to-end, fully automated research workflow* -- in the first course week. The activities below help you to structure your project. Stick to the plan to ensure you can finish the project in time.

## Planning

| Week | Project Stage | Working on | Deliverable/Feedback on |
|:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Getting started | Allocate teams & get idea about data context; think about research motivation | Register teams |
| 2 | GitHub | Set up *public* repository on Git, have initial readme with a preliminary research question and initialize directories | Create team repository via GitHub classroom |
| 3 | Data exploration | Refine research motivation, work with [GitHub Issues and Project Board](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/scrum) (columns "backlog", and the current sprint's "to do's", "in progress", and "done"), start exploring and auditing data | Coaching #1 - [Grading details](grading_details.md#1-github-repository) &#8594; 1.1 and 1.2 (Research Motivation and Repository Structure)
| 4 | Data preparation | Prepare data for analysis | Coaching #2 - [Grading details](grading_details.md#2-data-preparation--analysis) &#8594; 2.1 and 2.2 (Data exploration and Data Preparation)
| 5 | Automation  | Start automating your pipeline and refine source code | Coaching #3 - [Grading details](grading_details.md#3-source-code-and-automation) &#8594; 3.1 and 3.2 (Source code quality and degree of automation)
| 6 | Analysis and Deployment | Refine source code and analysis | Coaching #4 - [Grading details](grading_details.md#23-analysis-and-deployment-15) &#8594; 2.3 (Analysis and deployment)
| 7 | Wrap-up | Conduct final housekeeping checks  | Optional feedback meetings

<!--
### Weeks 2-4

- Reach out one another to form teams
- We'll reserve some time in the live streams to talk about potential projects and research/business ideas

### Week 5

- Finalize teams (registration on Canvas)

### Week 6: Feedback on data preparation and versioning

- Prepare data sets and start versioning your files
- Define research question and scope
- Set-up directory structure (`data`, `gen`, `src`) and plan pipeline
- Download the data directly from the source
- Start versioning your files and collaborating on GitHub

### Week 7: Feedback on workflow automation and data exploration
- Run R files from the command line
- Define all scripts strictly as ITO scripts
- Transformation / clean data
<!--  - Import data from `data` folder
  - Convert the date column into date/time format
  - Merge datasets on a comon column
  - Filter for rows that satisfy selection criteria
  - Group records on a categorical or date field and reshape data
  - Export output to generated files

- Test make file
- Point of discussion with coach: does your project reproduce when deleting temp files?

### Week 8: Feedback on deployment and reporting

- Choose how to deploy your insights, e.g., by means of regression analysis, or even by writing an app.
- Necessary components (e.g., for inspiration on how to write an app) are available in the building blocks section of the course site.
-->
<!--- Import data from `gen` folder
- Plot timeseries chart and export as pdf file
- Automate workflow with make
- Discuss results, conclusions, and limitations
- Create a data report and conduct exploratory analysis (summary statistics, report on missingness, number of observations)
