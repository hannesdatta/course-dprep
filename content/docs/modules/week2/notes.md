  - First half: work on tutorial on Git
    - Difference between Git & GitHub
    - All created accounts?
    - All teams onboarded?
    - Why to keep things in a repository? --> everybody can access it; plus you have a "digital" CV
    - readme is super important to onboard other users; we have templates at TSH to initialize it
    - Let's view a couple of amazing projects
      - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis [e.g., build API, list of public apis] --> https://github.com/topics; e.g., API, Covid19, Bitcoin; Firefox;
      - Let's check out famous researchers (e.g., Stanford GS lab)
      - Let's all do a workflow in Git
      - Let's now do the same in a desktop client

      - Show OhShitGit, and other sites
      - Show Gitignore
      - Show branching (example)?
      - Let's do a real website
      - PRs
      - Forking
      - Using Zenodo
      - Tips: just "go" and "try" with the flow
        - strictly use git for code, nothing else
        - tempting to work in "one" master
        - work in branches and with pull requests; work on individual features
        - meet up to discuss "your" branch, and put somebody in charge to merge PRs
        - SCRUM is a great way to organize yourselves! [SHOW SCRUM & PROJECT MANAGEMENT!!!!! tsh scrum stuff!!!]

  - Second half: review your Git repositories
      - put one team in the scrum setup, and organize their board
      - give feedback to other groups
