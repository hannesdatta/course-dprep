If you're new data marketing analytics or data science, you may wonder: what's all that fuzz on R about?

Well - when I grew up, the world was powered by Microsoft Excel. Up to about 65,000 rows and a couple of hundred columns - that's all you needed when you were into data analysis.

Today, though, datasets have become massive and demands for tools that can handle such data increased. R is one such tools that can handle large data sets, and conduct analysis.

The best thing about R though is that it's open source. It's freely usuable by anyone. Plus there's a vibrant community that keeps on developing R. Or extend it with your own packages.

If I was to use some proprietary software like SPSS or STATA, chance is you wouldn't even be able to run the software at your future employer!

So - while the data camp tutorials may look a little geeky, and you may rightfully wonder why you have to learn to use R like a calculator - bear with us for a few moments. At the end of this course, you'll see your skills developing tremendously!

So long!
