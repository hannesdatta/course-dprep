# Week 2: Version control and project management <!--+ feedback-->

## Kick-starting your week
- [Watch the kick-off for the week!](https://youtu.be/kL-s7XHWiWI) 

## Preparation before the tutorial
- Get a GitHub account and [work on this training](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) to familiarize yourself with GitHub (60 minutes)
{{% hint info %}}
- Please choose a professional GitHub username (e.g., *firstname.lastname*, *initial.lastname*, etc.). Chances are high you are going to use your GitHub profile when applying for jobs. 
- Experiencing any issues to authenticate with GitHub (e.g., an error message about your password)? Head over to the [support section](/docs/course/support) for how to solve this issue.

{{% /hint %}}
- Develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills
  - Check out the ([Datacamp tutorial - first chapter only](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell))
  - Also check out [this presentation about the command line / terminal](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl). 
    - Though it is targeted to Mac users, it provides a great overview.
    - Windows users could still follow along using *the same commands* by using Git Bash (or Cygwin). 
    - The main goal here is to understand how directory structures work and how to navigate in the terminal or command line.
