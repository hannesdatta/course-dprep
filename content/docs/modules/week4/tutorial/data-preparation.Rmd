# Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll take data preparation to the next level by considering a variety of common data issues in the Spotify Top 200 rankings. We'll start off with multiple raw big data sets and end up with a single data frame ready for analysis!

 
## What You'll Learn in this Tutorial
- Merge data sets on one or more indices and understand the different types of joins (inner, left, right join).
- Handle missing and duplicate values.
- Handle and preprocess string data (remove characters, splitting).
- Perform feature engineering.
- Use R Markdown to document your workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ready to start? Here's what we recommend you do before going through this tutorial.

* [Datacamp Introduction to Tidyverse](https://datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse/data-wrangling-1?ex=1) (chapter 1 and 3)

## Exploring the Beats: Inside the Spotify Top 200 Data
[Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) has listed the daily top 200 most streamed songs by country since 2017. As you can see below, you can use the dropdown menus to change your selection, and clicking in the top right corner returns the data in CSV-format.

For this exercise we have collected the rankings for 2020 which have been split up into 3 separate files: 

#### Streams

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| song_id | An identifier associated with each song | `22403119` |
| date | The date on which the ranking was composed | `2020-01-01 00:00:00+00:00` | 
| popularity | A popularity score between 0 and 100 on a given date | `95` |
| streams | The total number of streams on Spotify in a country on a given date | `544851` | 
| country | Country abbreviation | `US` | 


#### Songs

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| song_id | An identifier associated with each song | `22403119` |
| song_name | The name of the song | `WAP (feat. Megan Thee Stallion)` |
| artists |  A list of comma-separated artists of the song | `Cardi B,Megan Thee Stallion` | 
| genres | A list of comma-separated genres of the song | `pop,rap,houston rap,pop,trap queen` |

#### Country Codes 

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| continent | The continent associated with the country | `North America` |
| country | The name of the country | `United States of America` | 
| country_code_2_letter | The two-letter country code | `US` | 
| country_code_3_letter | The three-letter country code | `USA` | 
| country_number | The official ISO country code | `840` |



# Part 1: Downloading and Inspecting the Data 
## Create a new R project
1. Open RStudio and create a new project by clicking on `File` -> `New Project` -> `New Directory` -> `New Project`.
2. Name your project `data-preparation` and save it in a location of your choice.
3. Add a `data` folder:
- Option 1 (code): Run `dir.create("data")
- Option 2 (Manual): Click *New Folder (üìÅ)* in the Files pane  

## Download the data

Click [here](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/raw/master/content/docs/modules/week4/tutorial/data_without_duplicates.zip) to manually download the dataset. Alternatively, run the following R code to download and unzip the file automatically: 

```{r}
# downloading and unzipping the data
download.file('https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/raw/master/content/docs/modules/week4/tutorial/data_without_duplicates.zip', 'data.zip')
unzip('data.zip', overwrite=TRUE)
```
Now, load the data into R using `readr`'s `read_csv` and `read_delim` functions:

__Tip:__

*Note that CSV-files are separated by commas (hence the name comma-separated-value!), but they can also be separated by other delimiters (e.g., `;`). Rather than using `read_csv()`, you can use `read_delim()` and explicitly tell R which separation character (`delim=';'`) to use!*


```{r}
#install.packges("readr") # uncomment and run this if you have not installed `readr` package in R
library(readr)

streams <- read_csv("streams.csv")
songs <- read_csv("songs.csv")
country_codes <- read_delim("country_codes.csv", delim = ";")
```
__Troubleshooting__

- If R doesn‚Äôt find your file: Click **Session ‚Üí Set working directory ‚Üí To source file location**. Avoid using `setwd()` ‚Äî hardcoding directories can cause problems!

## üìå Exercise 1: Data Inspection
Your task is to examine the datasets and identify the following: 

1. What is the target unit of analysis? (*The unit of analysis tells us what each row in the dataset represents.*)
2. Are there any missing values in the columns?
3. Are there any values that are out of range and do not make sense?
4. Are "string" values properly encoded?
5. What are common columns across the three datasets?

__Tips:__

- Take a __look__ at the data using the function `head(streams)`, or `View(streams)`. If you'd like to view more rows with `head`, use `head(streams, 100)` (for, e.g., the first 100 rows). (`tail()` gives you the last rows of the data).

- The command `summary(songs)` or `glimpse(songs)` generates descriptive statistics for all variables in the data. You can also use this command on individual columns (e.g., `summary(streams$date)`).

- Character or factor columns are best inspected using the `table()` command. These will create frequency tables.

```{r, echo = TRUE, webex.hide = 'Solutions to Exercise 1'}

# View the first rows of the datasets to get an overview
head(streams)
head(songs)
head(country_codes)

# 1. Identify target unit of analysis 
# Ans: The streams data set contains the top 200 songs on given date in a country. 

# 2. Missing values 
colSums(is.na(streams)) # popularity and song_id have missing values
colSums(is.na(songs)) # lot of missing values in genres
colSums(is.na(country_codes))

# 3. Out of range values
# overall checks 
summary(streams)
summary(songs)
summary(country_codes)
# You could check more specifically. For e.g. if popularity scores are between 0 and 100 (based on data description)
summary(streams$popularity)

# 4. Check string formatting
# Find song names with non-ASCII characters
non_ascii_songs <- songs %>%
  filter(!grepl("^[ -~]+$", song_name))

print(non_ascii_songs)

# 5. Common columns
common_cols1 <- intersect(names(streams), names(songs))
print(common_cols1) # song_id

common_cols2 <- intersect(names(streams), names(country_codes))
print(common_cols2) #country

```

# Part 2: Merging 
In this section, we want to prepare the final dataset by merging the three datasets. The "join" functions from `dplyr` come in handy for this. 

## üìå Exercise 2: 

Examine the effect of picking a `left_join`, `right_join`, and `inner_join`, and how that affects the completeness of your data. Strive for a final data frame that captures as much of the original data as possible.

1. Merge the streams data with the songs dataframe. 
2. Merge the streams data with country_codes dataframe
3. Export the final data frame as `merged_df.csv` after merging all 3 datasets.

__Tips:__

- Identify common columns across the datasets.
- Look up the Datacamp tutorials for the syntax for join functions. 
- To avoid confusion between overlapping column names (e.g., country appears in both `streams.csv` and `country_codes.csv`), you may consider adding suffixes. 


```{r, webex.hide = 'Solutions to Exercise 2'}
df <- streams %>% 
  inner_join(songs, by = "song_id") %>%
  left_join(country_codes, by = c("country" = "country_code_2_letter"), suffix = c("_streams", "_cc"))

# Since countries in Oceania are missing in country_codes.csv we use a left join here (otherwise you'd miss out on +/- 139K records)

write_csv(df, "merged_df.csv")

```
# Part 3: Data Pre-Processing

## üìå Exercise 3a: Removing Duplicates
A track can appear in multiple top 200 lists across countries (e.g., both in the Netherlands and in Belgium) for sustained periods of time (e.g., yesterday and today). For that reason, a `song_id` may occur repeatedly within the data frame. Yet it can also happen that exactly the same record appears more than once. For example, the scraper that collected the data in the first place might have run twice which duplicated some of the records, or we accidentally made a copy-paste mistake ourselves. Check whether such duplicates are present in `df` and if so remove them. Export the result as `df_no_duplicates.csv`.

```{r, webex.hide = 'Solutions to Exercise 3a'}
#input
df <- read_csv("merged_df.csv")

# transformation
df <- df %>% filter(!duplicated(df))

# output
write_csv(df, "df_no_duplicates.csv")
```

## üìå Exercise 3b: Data Imputation

In roughly half of the cases, the `popularity` column is missing which turns out to be troublesome once you move towards a model building phase. Therefore, we ask you to impute these missing values by the median popularity score of the country on a given date. Here's a simple example to illustrate: 

| song_name | country | date | popularity | popularity_filled | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| A | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 91 | 91 |
| B | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 66 | 66 |
| C | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | `NA` |  **66** |
| D | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 62 | 62 | 
| E | United Kingdom | 02-01-2020 | 79 | 79 | 
| A | Netherlands | 01-01-2020 | 80 | 80 |

The `popularity_filled` column has been added which takes on the value of the `popularity` column if present and otherwise missing data (`NA`) are replaced with their imputed values. In this example, the popularity of song `C` in the United Kingdom has been computed as the median of `{62, 66, 91} = 66`. Note that it does not take into account song `E` in the United Kingdom (different date) and song `A` in the Netherlands (different country).   

Implement this data imputation strategy using the `filter`, `groupby`, and `summarise` functions from the `dplyr` package and the result as `df_imputed.csv`. We recommend first computing the imputation values (for each country across the days), and then replacing missing values in the `popularity` column with their matching counterparts. Evaluate your results in terms of the pros and cons of this approach and try to come up with an alternative imputation strategy (incl. arguments why you prefer that approach).

```{r, webex.hide = 'Solutions to Exercise 3b'}
# input
df <- read_csv("df_no_duplicates.csv")

# transformation
imputation_values <- df %>% filter(!is.na(popularity)) %>% 
  group_by(country, date) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_filled = median(popularity))

df_joined <- df %>% left_join(imputation_values, by = c("country" = "country", "date" = "date"))

df <- df_joined %>% mutate(popularity_filled = ifelse(is.na(popularity), popularity_filled, popularity))

# The main disadvantage is that missing records will always be assigned a median popularity score (so never abnormally low or high). Given the sheer amount of missing records, this would highly distort the distribution of the scores.
# Since the popularity score is country independent and it is either present for all records or not available for any country (or time period), we should find a way to group songs together. For example, if the artist has other songs for which the popularity score is known we could take the median of those scores, or we could look for songs with similar genre tag words.

# output
write_csv(df, "df_imputed.csv")
```
# Part 4: Feature Engineering

## üìå Exercise 4a: Creating Trend Variable

More likely than not, you have come across the `lm()` (i.e., linear model) function once before during your studies. Then, you also know that a regression model can only interpret numeric data. Categorical fields are typically converted into so-called dummy variables that take on either the value `0` or `1`. In a similar vein, dates are often converted into trend variables as input for a time-series model. For example, in our dataset January the 1st, of 2020 becomes 1 and the 15th of December 2020 (the last entry of `df`) becomes 350. Follow the steps below to create this trend variable for the `date` column of `df`: 

1. Study the [documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.Date.html) of the `seq` function to create a sequence of dates (see examples at the bottom of the page).
2. Create a data frame `dates` with two columns: `date` (i.e., the sequence of dates) and `counter` (i.e., a numeric value between 1 and 350). Tip: you may first need to convert the `dates` column into character format (`as.charcter(date)`).
3. Merge `df` and `dates` and inspect your results (which type of join do you use?)


```{r eval=FALSE, webex.hide = 'Solution Exercise 5'}
# Step 1
date <- seq(min(as.Date(df$date)), max(as.Date(df$date)), by = "day")

# Step 2
counter <- 1:length(date)
dates <- data.frame(counter=counter, date=date)

# Step 3
df <- df %>% inner_join(dates, by = "date")
```

## üìå Exercise 4b: Creating ranks 

Even though the data frame represents the Spotify top 200 charts, none of the columns indicates the rank of a given track. We can easily derive it from the number of streams, the `date`, and the `country` column. The built-in R function `ranks` returns a vector of ranks for a given input. By default, the lowest digit gets the highest rank (e.g., 1 becomes rank 1), you can reverse the order by adding a minus sign (`-`) in front of the input vector:

```{r}
rank_example = c(4, 9, 3, 2, 1)
# regular 
print(rank(rank_example))
# reversed
print(rank(-rank_example)) 
```

Add a `ranking` column to `df` using the `dplyr` package and export the result as `df_ranking.csv`. Although it is unlikely that some tracks have exactly the same number of streams, think about how you will deal with these edge cases (tip: run `?rank` to look up the documentation). Does your ranking always run from 1 to 200? Why is that? Investigate the root cause and fix it! 

```{r eval=FALSE, webex.hide = 'Solution Exercise 4b'}
# input
df <- read_csv("df_imputed.csv")

# transformation
df <- df %>% group_by(country, date) %>%
  mutate(ranking = rank(-streams, ties.method = "random"))

# The maximum ranking is 400 (rather than 200)
# Once we inspect one of the listings of df[df$ranking >= 200, ] we find that these records typically have redundant data somewhere hidden in between. For example, for df[(df$date == "2020-05-17") & (df$country == "HK"),] we discover that ranking 59 appears 17 times (!) which can be attributed to missing values `song_id` 

# remove rows without song_id (if you then recreate the ranking column you'll come to the conclusion the maximum ranking has become 200!)
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(song_id))

# output
write_csv(df, "df_ranking.csv")
```
# Part 5: Pivoting the Data 

Most tracks are assigned to more than one genre. For example, the famous song "Se√±orita" by Shawn Mendes and Camilo Cabello is categorized as `pop`, but also as `canadian pop`, `post-teen pop`, `viral pop`, and `dance pop`. The data frame stores these records as a list of comma-separated genres. On a high level, we like to move from this state: 

| song_name | genres | 
| :----- | :---- | 
| Se√±orita | `pop, canadian pop, post-teen pop, viral pop, dance pop` | 


To a format in which the columns represent genre tag words and the table values indicate which genre(s) belong to which `song_name`: 

| song_name | k-pop | pop | canadian pop | post-teen pop | viral pop | dance pop | 
| :----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| Se√±orita | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Memories | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Psycho | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |



To this end, we first need to separate the `genres` column of `df` into individual genres. We can use the built-in R function `strsplit` for that in the following way (note the double brackets `[[]]` around `1`!): 



```{r}
genres_example <- c("pop", "canadian pop", "post-teen pop", "viral pop", "dance pop")
genres_example_split <- split(genres_example, ",")
genres_example_split[[1]]

```

After some data wrangling we can transform the data into the following format: 

| song_id | song_genre | 
| :----- | :---- | 
| 13594414 | pop | 
| 13594414 | canadian pop | 
| 13594414 | post-teen pop | 
| 13594414 | viral pop | 
| 13594414 | dance pop | 
| 13977556 | pop` | 


## üìå Exercise 5: Reshape the data
As a last step, we use the `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to change the format of our data frame (see, e.g., [this overview](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) or these [code snippets](https://dcl-wrangle.stanford.edu/pivot-advanced.html)). We then store the results in `df_reshaped.csv`. 

Following these steps, it's your turn to create a data set, with (a) rows being the dates, (b) columns being the song IDs, and (c) the cells indicating a song's sum of streams.


```{r eval=FALSE, webex.hide = 'Solution Exercise 5'}
# load input
df <- read_csv("df_ranking.csv")

song_popularity = df %>% pivot_wider(id_cols = date, names_from = 'song_id', values_from = 'streams', values_fn = sum)

# let us look at the columns (--> these are song IDs!)
colnames(song_popularity)

# let us look at the rows (--> these are dates!)
song_popularity$date[1:10]

# output
write_csv(song_popularity, "df_reshaped.csv")
```
