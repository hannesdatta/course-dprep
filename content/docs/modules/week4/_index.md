# Week 4: Engineering data sets


## Learning goals

- Apply data wrangling techniques using the Tidyverse to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis.
- Structure R scripts into modular components (setup, input, transformation, output) to facilitate reproducibility and automation.
- Implement common data operations (e.g., merging, aggregating, reshaping) and integrate basic programming concepts in R.
- Develop new variables and features (feature engineering) to enhance the analysis and understanding of datasets.
