# Preparation before the course starts

In this class, you'll learn the basics of R and GitHub, and how to use these tools to professionally working on empirical research projects.

It's important to spend some time *before the beginning of the class* to install the required software, and familiarize yourself with R/RStudio.

### 1) Install R and RStudio

Throughout the course, we'll use R - a comprehensive toolbox to handle and analyze large data sets. The best thing about R is that it's open source. It's freely usable by anyone. Plus there's a vibrant community that keeps on developing R. Or extend it with your own packages.

- Please install R and RStudio, by following these [setup instructions](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/r/).
- If you'd like, you can also already start working on the [R Bootcamp](docs/modules/week1) which we will cover in the first course week.

### 2) Get a GitHub account and install Git

Git is a file versioning tool - think of it as a combination of Dropbox (with unlimited & free rollbacks to previous file versions) and messaging client (to discuss projects with team members).

- Please install Git, by following these [setup instructions](
https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/git).
- Also get a [GitHub account](https://github.com). We advise you using a "presentable" username - very likely, your GitHub profile will be mentioned on your CV when you apply for jobs.
- Looking for a more graphical user experience? Then you may find [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) useful as well.

### 3) Install `make`

During this course, we'll be using Make - a tool used by software developers to automate workflows (e.g., to compile a new software program). Of course, we won't write entire software programs, but instead work on our project pipelines (that consist of preparing and analyzing data).

- You can find a tutorial for installing make [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/make).

### 4) Get a good text editor

We recommend using a text editor, as this greatly improves your user experience and allows you to easily change text and code.

- [Click here to install Visual Studio as your text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### 5) Get premium access to Datacamp.com

Finally, we're borrowing some tutorials from [Datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com) throughout this course.

- Please follow these steps to [obtain access to premium content of Datacamp](docs/course/support/datacamp.md).

### 6) Follow Datacamp.com tutorials for learning R

- Please follow [this Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) at Datacamp.com.
