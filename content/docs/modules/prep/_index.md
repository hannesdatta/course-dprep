# Preparation before the course starts

In this class, you'll learn the basics of R and GitHub, and how to use these tools to professionally working on empirical research projects.

It's important to spend some time *before the beginning of the class* to install the required software, and familiarize yourself with R/RStudio.

### 1) Install R and RStudio

Throughout the course, we'll use R - a comprehensive toolbox to handle and analyze large data sets. The best thing about R is that it's open source. It's freely usable by anyone. Plus there's a vibrant community that keeps on developing R. Or extend it with your own packages.

- Please install R and RStudio, by following these [setup instructions](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/r/).
- If you'd like, you can also already start working on the [R Bootcamp](docs/modules/week1) which we will cover in the first course week.

### 2) Get a GitHub account and install Git

Git is a file versioning tool - think of it as a combination of Dropbox (with unlimited & free rollbacks to previous file versions) and messaging client (to discuss projects with team members).

- Please install Git, by following these [setup instructions](
https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/git).
- Signup to [GitHub.com](https://github.com). 

{{% hint info %}}
- When signing up to GitHub, we recommend choosing a professional GitHub username (e.g., *firstname.lastname*, *initial.lastname*, etc.). Chances are high you are going to use your GitHub profile when applying for jobs. 
- Looking for a more graphical user experience? Then you may find [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) useful as well.
- Experiencing any issues to authenticate with GitHub (e.g., an error message about your password)? Head over to the [support section](/docs/course/support) for how to solve this issue.

### 3) Install `make`

During this course, we'll be using Make - a tool used by software developers to automate workflows (e.g., to compile a new software program). Of course, we won't write entire software programs, but instead work on our project pipelines (that consist of preparing and analyzing data).

- You can find a tutorial for installing make [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/make).

### 4) Get a good text editor

We recommend using a text editor, as this greatly improves your user experience and allows you to easily change text and code.

- [Click here to install Visual Studio as your text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### 5) Get premium access to Datacamp.com

Finally, we're borrowing some tutorials from [Datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com) throughout this course.

- Please follow these steps to [obtain access to premium content of Datacamp](docs/course/support/datacamp.md).

### 6) Follow useful tutorials

- New to R?
    - Then please follow [this Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) at Datacamp.com.
- Never worked with the command line/bash/terminal? 
    - Then please develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills
    - Check out the ([Datacamp tutorial - first chapter only](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell))
    - Also check out [this presentation about the command line / terminal](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl). 
        - Though it is targeted to Mac users, it provides a great overview.
        - Windows users could still follow along using *the same commands* by using Git Bash (or Cygwin). 
        - The main goal here is to understand how directory structures work and how to navigate in the terminal or command line.
- New to GitHub?
    - Then [work on this training](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) to familiarize yourself with it (60 minutes)
