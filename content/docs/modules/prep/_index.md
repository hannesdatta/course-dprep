# Preparation before the course starts

This course requires an advanced software setup before you can get started. So, please spend some time carefully working through the software installation guide!

- [Install software (R & RStudio, Git, automation & build tools) now](../../../docs/tutorials/software-installation/_index.md)

We also use some premium content of Datacamp.com, so make sure to sign up using your Tilburg University account to be able to follow the material.

Finally, familiarize yourself with this course page, and visit [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com), a platform we'll use to learn and further develop our skills in building reproducible workflows.
