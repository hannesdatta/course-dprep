# Tutorial: Project Management and Version Control with Git/GitHub

## Learning goals

* Setup Git and GitHub, and know what both are
* Experience the power of file versioning (e.g., restoring, branching) from the command line/terminal
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow, using simple text files created in the editor
* Learn to collaborate on projects using GitHub

## Planning

* Please plan about one day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills
    - What is the [command line / terminal](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl)?!
    - Start practicing using the [DataCamp Introduction to Shell](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell) (chapter 1).

2. [Familiarize yourself with GitHub by working on this tutorial!](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

3. Apply the end-to-end Git workflow using Git Bash (i.e., through the command line) ([View tutorial](version-control.html))

__Curious how to use Git with a graphical user interface?__
(optional, but highly useful)

- [Sourcetreeapp](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a free Git client for Windows, Mac and Linux!
- Git also [smoothly integrates with R - find out how!](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/)
