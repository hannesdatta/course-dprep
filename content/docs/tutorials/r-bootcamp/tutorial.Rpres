Structure of this tutorial
========================================================

<br>
<br> 
- In-class part
  - 11.45-12.30: Introduction to R
  - break
  - 12.45-13.30: Starting with data and data wrangling
 
*This part features __selected__ issues.*

- After class: please complete chapters 1-4 [at your own pace](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/).

Introduction to R
========================================================
incremental: true

- What is R? What is RStudio?
- Why learn R?
  - no point and clicking (good!)
  - great for reproducibility
  - interdisciplinary & extensible
  - supports all data formats
  - can produce high-quality graphics
  - has a large community
  - it's free, open-source and cross-platform!
  - works even in the cloud!

DO: Creating a new project
========================================================

- Under the *File menu*, click on *New project*, choose *New directory*, then *New project*
- Enter a *name for this new folder* (or “directory”) and choose a *convenient location* for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/data-carpentry)
- Click on *Create project*
- Create a *new file* where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as *“script.R”*.

The RStudio Interface
========================================================
incremental: true

- four panes: source code, console, environment/history, files
- setting and checking working directories (`setwd()` and `getwd()`)
- relative directories vs. absolute directories, use of `here()`

DO: Organize working directory
==========

- Directory structure (for tutorial; different structures used later)

<img src="https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/fig/rstudio_project_files.jpeg"  width=50% height=20%>

```{r}
dir.create("data") # continue w/ other directories
```
- Can you come up with other ways to create a folder/directory structure?

Interacting with R
========================
incremental: true

- Running code (ctrl + R, buttons, running code top-down)
- Installing additional packages (package tab, `install.packages()`)
<br><br>
- DO: Let's all verify package `tidyverse` is installed!

Using R
========================
incremental: true

- as a calculator
- variable assignment
- calculating with variables
- = vs. ==
- functions
  - using functions (e.g., `round()`)
  - getting help on functions
  - what functions exist? --> [cheat sheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf) for base R
- vectors and data types (`c(1,2,3)`, `c("Berlin", "Barcelona")`, `NA`)
- subsetting vectors (explicitly, conditionally with logical operators)

DO: A bit of practice
========================

1. Assign the following values to the variable `rooms`: 1, 2, 1, 8
2. Use the function `max()` to calculate the maximum number of rooms 
3. Modify rooms by adding `NA` to it: 1, 2, 1, 8, NA
4. Recalculate the maximum & check the help (`?max`, followed by enter) to see how to tackle the problem!
5. Write a bit of code to return the third value of `rooms`
6. Write a bit of code to return the number of rooms larger or equal to 2. Tip: `length()` & conditional subsetting required!

Starting with data
============

- individual values vs. "holding data" (rows, colums)
- difference between Excel & R? Each column holds the same data type!
- R tutorial proceeds w/ non-marketing data; here, we use some music streaming data instead
<br><br>



DO: Download and open the dataset!
============

- Download the data to your computer

```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/master/content/docs/modules/week4/regional-global-daily-latest.csv", "streams.csv")
```

- Load the data into R using the tidyverse `read_csv()` function

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
streams <- read_csv('streams.csv', skip=1)
```

- Then, take a look at the data by typing in the console...

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
streams # full preview
head(streams) # limited preview
view(streams) # point-and click view
nrow(streams) # number of rows ("size")
summary(streams) # show basic summary statistics
```

Tips: 
- Beware of "looking" at large datasets! `nrow(streams)` is your friend!
- You may have to experiment with options in `read_csv`, e.g., separation characters.

Working with data from a table
===========
incremental: true

- `$column_name` shows data, e.g., `streams$Artist`
- make use of tabs for auto-completion!
- converting character variables to factor variables (and back); `as.factor()`
- self-study preview: using dates!

`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

`select()`: subsetting/selecting columns

```{r}
streams %>% select(`Track Name`)
```

`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

`filter()`: subset rows on conditions

```{r}
streams %>% filter(`Track Name` == "Pepas")
```


`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

`mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns

```{r}
streams <- streams %>% mutate(weekly_streams = `Streams` * 7)
streams %>% select(`Track Name`, `Streams`, weekly_streams)
```

`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

`group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data

```{r}
streams %>% group_by(Artist) %>% summarize(total_streams = sum(Streams))
```

`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

`arrange()`: sort results; use `desc()` to show in *descending* order

```{r}
streams %>% group_by(Artist) %>% summarize(total_streams = sum(Streams)) %>% arrange(desc(total_streams))
```

`dplyr` 101: basic commands and pipes
===========

- `count()`: count discrete values

```{r}
streams %>% count(Streams>1E6)
```

DO: Let's practice!
=========

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

<br>

1. Show only the columns Artist and Track Name from streams. Tip: `select()`
2. Show all observations by Lil Nas X. Tip: `filter()`
3. Sum up all streams by artist: Tip: `group_by()` and `summarize()`
4. Sort the results from (3) in descending order

__Tip: also check out the `dplyr` [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

Writing a code file (and running it in your terminal)
========================================================

- We use RStudio for prototyping code
- For "production", we usually run our code via the terminal/command line
- First, we have to store our code as a `.R` file
- Then, we can call it via the terminal
  - `R --vanilla < filename.R` (gives output)
  - `Rscript filename.R` (gives only output if made explicit)
  
__Let's try it out!__
