# Tutorial: Data Management with SQL

## Learning goals

SQL is one of the most prominent ways to extract data from databases - either from research databases, or from companies' internal databases. As a marketing analyst, it is crucial to learn how to extract data from existing databases. This can be very challenging, because data is not readily prepared (but needs to first be prepared to be extracted). This is made even more complicated because the databases of firms do not consist of a thousand rows, but may include millions or even billions of rows.

In short, learning the SQL language significantly improves your chances to score a good job in the job market. This is an optional tutorial which walks you through the main ideas of SQL. In going through it, try to see similarities and differences with regards to other things that you learn in Data Preparation and Workflow Management.
