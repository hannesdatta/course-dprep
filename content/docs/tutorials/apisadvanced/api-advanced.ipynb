We hope working with various endpoints from the Spotify API have given you the confidence to explore other [endpoints](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) on your own and - perhaps - have even sparked you interest in analyzing the online streaming market. As a suggestion, you want to look into which tracks are listed on Spotify [playlists](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/), and which playlists are in turn [featured](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/) on Spotify. If you're interested in the relevance of playlist curation, have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbmCVRkmCAc) weblecture I recorded for the Universiteit van Nederland (in Dutch).\n",
