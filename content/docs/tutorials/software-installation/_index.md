# Tutorial: Software Installation

## R and RStudio

Throughout the course, we'll use R - a comprehensive toolbox to handle and analyze large data sets. The best thing about R is that it's open source. It's freely usable by anyone. Plus there's a vibrant community that keeps on developing R. Or extend it with your own packages.

- Please install R and RStudio, by following these [setup instructions](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/r/).

- If you'd like, you can also already start working on the [R Bootcamp Tutorial](docs/tutorials/r-bootcamp) which we will cover in the first course week.

## Git and GitHub

Git are tools that allow you to "version" files - think of it as a combination of Dropbox (with unlimited & free rollbacks to previous file versions) and messaging client (to discuss projects with team members).

- Please install Git, by following these [setup instructions](
https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/git).

- Looking for a more graphical user experience? Then you may find [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) useful as well.

## Make

During this course, we'll be using Make - a tool used by software developers to automate workflows (e.g., to compile a new software program). Of course, we won't write entire software programs, but instead work on our project pipelines (that consist of preparing and analyzing data).

- You can find a tutorial for installing make [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/make).

## Datacamp.com

Finally, we're borrowing some tutorials from [Datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com) throughout this course.

- Please learn how to [obtain access to premium content of Datacamp here](docs/course/support/datacamp.md).
