# Part 1: Exploring new data

## Motivation

Need to explore *new* data (different formats), and share results of exploration with others

## Key considerations

>- Has data been delivered correctly?
- Do I understand all variables?
- Is the data complete?
- and much more (--> Mela 2011)

## Activity: Data Exploration

see week 1 --> [activity on the course website](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/modules/week1/activity/)

## Break

Please put your Tutorial Q&A questions in the chat, or prepare yourselves to unmute yourself after the break and tell us what's been bugging you.

Please install TeamViewer, and - if requested - send your ID and password via WhatsApp to +31134668938.

# Part 2: Tutorial Q&A

## Open questions

Please ask your questions by unmuting yourself, or by using the chat!


## Key idea 1: Limit data size

## Key idea 2: Use packages

- e.g., `data.table` for loading and wrangling

## Key idea 3: Use cheat sheets

## Key idea 4: Using stackoverflow

## Tips: Writing loops to load data


## Next week: Data wrangling

- *Preview* material on the site
- Next meeting: Friday, 12 February, 2021

## Any questions?

Stick around now if you have questions.

(e.g., installation issues, prep week)

::: notes

* can use the break for installation problems
* show on the website where they can find the information they need
* how to download the files (right click)
* manage expectations: DataCamp courses are simplistic (copy-paste etc.) and should not take too long, the data challenges are more challenging and will likely take more time, and are more representative of the level we expect in this course.
