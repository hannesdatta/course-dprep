## Lessons learnt #1

__Business and Data Understanding__

- RMarkdown! (mixing code with reporting)
  - ability to quickly produce clean docs to share!
- What *are* the components of a research project?
  - ability to identify what's missing!
- Doing data quality checks? (--> activity)
  - getting back to your data supplier if needed!

## Lessons learnt #2

__Data preparation__

- Why do we actually *have* to clean up data?!
  - re-watch it: https://youtu.be/z_Hh1jlL1Ac
- Data prep code can be sooo complex
  - so... use cheatsheets!
- Make ITO blocks (input, transformation, output!)
  - yeah, crucial for `make`, too!

## Lessons learnt #3

__Pipeline building and automation__

- Clarity about *where* to store stuff
- Run the work others have done
  - my work, your work, somebody else's work (e.g., text mining stuff on tilburgsciencehub.com)
- Discover mistakes in code
  - e.g., packages that weren't loaded, order of cells/code
- Save time!
  - but, yeah, NOT at the beginning when you still learn

## Lessons learnt #4

__Versioning and Project Management with GitHub__

- Rolling back whenever you want
  - delete stuff that isn't needed
- Collaborate with one another
  - less risk of "destroying" one's work
- Manage projects professionally
  - e.g., issues, project board
- Learn the tools used in business

# Reflection

- what a tough learning experience!
- many started from scratch
- others thought they could program, but were challenged, too!
- saw so much: different projects, datasets, software programs, "way of doing things", videos, websites

My recommendation: take time to let it sink in. And trust in my choice of teaching you this. Your hard work will pay off.


# Looking ahead

## During your studies (1)

- Gradually implement across classes or projects
  - e.g., some projects just benefit from better directory structure, while others may need "more"

- Realize it takes time to learn
  - it took me years to become proficient

## During your studies (2)

- Use for thesis!
  - but, be aware your skills are *so* fresh, your professor likely has never heard about it! --> use, teach, show how productive you are!

- Build your job market profile
  - e.g., have a Hugo website with your CV
  - e.g., "pin" your best repositories (but don't call them `dprep-team-X`; remember, you're a marketer!)


## During your studies (3)

- Become part of the open science community
  - contribute to [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com); maybe we will hire RAs
  - join https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-science-community-tilburg/
  - Watch out for projects at https://tiu.nu/who-does-open-science

## After your studies

- be confident!
- become a data wizard like me ;)
- automate stuff, save time for the things you love!
- most importantly: seize opportunities
  - as a researcher
  - as an entrepreneur
  - as a citizen who *knows* data & tech opportunities
- "shake it up"/"mix it" with your unique skillset


# Next steps

## Official course evaluation

- Course evaluation has been critical to my career
  - Without my past (very good) evaluations, I wouldn't be teaching to you today
  - I will look at all comments
- Fill it in now at https://tiu.nu/evaluate
- Scores are most important to show importance of this course

::: notes

  - e.g., new (?) format (live streams rather than lectures)
  - e.g., new content (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks rather than books)
  - ...

:::

## Informal feedback

- live streams versus lectures?
- quality of internet website?
- open education good or bad?
- like the presence of external students (or not)?
- quality of R Notebooks, videos, etc.
- "innovativeness of material", etc.
