## Lessons learnt #1: Versioning and Project Management with Git(Hub) (I)

::: incremental
- Scrum & the project board as a way to collaborate with one another
  - Writing issues is hard (!)
  - Seems to put a lot of structure on stuff, did it work out?
  - Recall how to work together -- team <-> individual
- Versioning can be powerful!
  - `git log` to see recent commits
  - Delete stuff that isn't needed ("housekeeping"), roll back when you want (`git checkout <COMMIT_ID> -b branch`)
  - Oh no, not authenticated! (browser authentication using `gh auth` works best)
  - Oh no! Can't push! (pull first!)
  - Use GUIs (e.g., in R or VS Code), complemented with Git Bash
:::

## Lessons learnt #1: Versioning and Project Management with Git(Hub) (II)

::: incremental
- Ready to use Git/versioning in a business setting
  - Clone repositories, switch branches (`git switch BRANCHNAME` or `git checkout BRANCHNAME`)
  - Know what to version, and what not
  - Use `.gitignore` (and know what it CANNOT do)
  - Work together using issues, feature branches & pull requests (PRs)/merge requests
- Collaborate on open source projects (know what forks are)
:::

---

## Lessons learnt #2: Data Exploration

::: incremental
- RMarkdown! (mixing code with reporting)
  - Ability to quickly produce clean documents to share!
  - Uh... but how to run it with make? --> `R -e 'rmarkdown::render(input = "test_render.Rmd", output_file = "test_render.html")'`
  - __Verify you can render markdown documents to HTML and PDF!__
- Doing data quality checks?
  - Getting back to your data supplier if needed!
  - Reporting summary statistics (`summary`, `table`, `dplyr` for summary stats by group)
  - Plotting with `ggplot2`
- Use RMarkdown when it is *useful* (i.e., to produce a doc, slides; NOT for data cleaning)
:::

---

## Lessons learnt #3: Data Engineering

::: incremental
- Why do we actually *have* to [clean up data](https://youtu.be/z_Hh1jlL1Ac)?
- Data prep code can be complex
  - So... use cheatsheets (also for the exam!)
  - Know & apply common data operations (what are those?)
- Make setup-ITO blocks
  - Setup to load libraries, __then__ input, transformation, output!
  - Super crucial for `make`, too! (know why?)
- Modularize code, loop, and use functions
:::

---

## Lessons learnt #4: Pipeline building and automation

::: incremental
- Clarity about *where* to store stuff
  - Review! (components - `src`, `gen`, `data`; modules - e.g., `analysis`, `data-prep`, ...)
- Run the work others have done
- Discover mistakes in code
  - E.g., packages that weren't loaded, order of cells/code
- Save time with automatic execution
- Continuously improve documentation & code
:::

---

## Common mistakes with `make`

- Wrong: One "all" rule with all targets as prerequisites (correct: final products/files to be built)
- Wrong: Incomplete dependencies (correct: all input files + own source code per recipe)
- Wrong: Multiple Rscript execution commands per recipe (correct: write separate rules)
- Gradually build your makefile. __Go in baby steps!__
- Happy to take a look at your repositories now - anyone?

---

## Any other questions about your projects?

__We can address them now!__

---

## Looking ahead: During your studies (I)

::: incremental
- __Selectively__ implement across classes or projects
  - E.g., some projects just benefit from better directory structure, while others may need "more"
  - Risk of "losing" the skill (!)
- Realize it takes time to learn (and debug!)
  - It took me years to become proficient
  - Onboard team members to "your" way of working
:::

---

## Looking ahead: During your studies (II)

::: incremental
- Use for thesis!
  - But, be aware your skills are fresh, your professor likely has never heard about it! --> use, teach, show how productive you are!
- Build your job market profile
  - Have a compelling about page on GitHub
  - "Pin" your best repositories (but don't call them `dprep-team-X`; remember)
- Become part of the community at Tilburg, e.g., [tilburg.ai](https://tilburg.ai) or [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com)
:::


## Looking ahead: After your studies

::: incremental
- On your job... automate stuff & save time for the things you love!
- Invest into additional skills relevant for data engineering (e.g., SQL!, but also Docker)

:::

---

## Next steps: Submissions and preparing for the exam

- Deadline for project coming up!
  - Remember: __test project__ on different computers or operating systems
  - __Do not use__ absolute paths!
  - Verify data can be downloaded smoothly
  - Test `make` thoroughly
  - Avoid testing any statistical assumptions - this is about a running workflow, not about research methods!

---

## Exam 

- Re-watch my recording from Friday (Q&A)
- Work through example questions (posted on Canvas)
- Work on shared cheat sheet

---

## Next steps: Official course evaluation

- Course evaluation has been immensely important to this course
  - This semester: wrote a book :-) (how did you like it?!)
  - Last semester: overhauled all tutorials (e.g., `ggplot2` in week 2, advanced engineering in week 4)
  - Previous years: switched order of sessions, revised GitHub tutorial/onboarding, new data sets, coaching sessions with breakout groups on campus and online

- Course evaluation has been critical to my career
  - Without my past evaluations, I wouldn't be teaching to you today
  - I will look at all comments. Based on student feedback, we now have Q&A for setups & additional Q&As towards the end of the course.
  - __Scores are most important to show importance of this course__

---

## Next steps: Self- and peer assessment

- You will be invited via e-mail
- To be filled in using Google Forms

---

## Informal feedback

::: incremental
- How was this course for beginners? 
- How did you like the book? Helpful? Daunting?
- Tutorials: easy/hard? pre-recorded vs. not?
- Coaching sessions? Got your fair share of comments?
- __What's are three things you'd like me to change in this course?__
