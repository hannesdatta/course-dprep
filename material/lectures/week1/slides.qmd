## Welcome to dPrep!

We're about to start with the first lecture of this class.

If you haven't done so, please check out the **Canvas page** for this course:

- explore the *course syllabus*
- complete the *software installation* (see "preparation before this class on Canvas)
- check out my slides on the *modules* page

<!--
- drafted this course for a very long time
- finally got the chance to teaching it now
- what is it about: radical change in the way to work on data-intensive projects
- anything you've learnt so far is about stats, or substantive areas, not about HOW to work on projects
- happy to share that vision, and share practical tips
-->

## Agenda

- Part 1 (12.45–13.45)
  - Meeting each other
  - Motivation for the course
  - Course framework and learning goals
  - Agenda and practical arrangements
- Break
- Part 2 (14.00–15.30/15.45): R Bootcamp on your laptops

## Disclaimer

::: incremental
- Mix of lectures, teamwork and self-study — all are necessary
  - I do the lectures and course coordination
  - Javier Torralba Flores will help you master the tutorial sessions
  - Roshini Sudhaharan will coach you on the team projects
- About me
  - I record my lectures and post them on Canvas (remind me if I miss to post one--or forget to start the recording)
  - Consider me your coach, not your 'distant professor'
  - Slow me down (yes, that’s needed!)
- You will have to invest a lot of time and energy

## Getting to know you

::: incremental
- Ever wrangled with messy data? How did you clean it? Did you team up or go solo?
- What programming languages do you know--if at all? Who’s ever used R?
- Imagine your dream job — what’s it going to be?
:::

---

## Motivation for course (I)

- Did my PhD in quantitative marketing
- Coded a lot (data prep, modeling), but didn’t *learn how to structure my work*
- Created a [complete chaos](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/Automation/Workflows/Starting/principles-of-project-setup-and-workflow-management/structure_phd_2013) (but still [got published](https://doi.org/10.1509%2Fjmr.12.0160))

---

## Motivation for course (II)

- Couldn’t find code that prepped the dataset
- Couldn’t find code of the econometric model that eventually got published

---

## What was so bad about it?

- **Replicability**  
  Couldn’t replicate results later
- **Reproducibility**  
  Peers couldn’t understand/implement my workflow
- **Efficiency**  
  - Changes required rerunning everything from scratch  
  - Years later, a colleague asked for data &rarr; it wasn’t documented

---

## Why should you care?

- You will soon work on data-intensive projects — thesis, internship, business
- You will change code *continuously*
- Team members/colleagues need to read and reuse your code
- Learning “good practices” takes time, but…  

<br>
&rarr; even small **efficiency** gains pay off quickly

---

## What’s efficient?

::: incremental
- Prototype the “final research pipeline” early, refine later
- Reduce setup costs when returning to a project
- Catch coding mistakes faster
- Collaborate by rotating tasks
- Share/reuse code (e.g., via packages)
- Get feedback from others
:::

---

## What’s not efficient?

::: incremental
- Waiting (for results or data prep)
- Getting distracted while waiting
- Forgetting how things were done (and why)
- Losing data
- Using undocumented code
:::

---

## Course objectives

- Develop coding skills
  - Use R to clean and transform data for analysis (e.g., dataset engineering, week 4)
  - Use R for reporting and plotting (e.g., RMarkdown, week1)
- Collaborate on code/projects
  - Document with unlimited version history
  - Examples: [a research article](https://github.com/hannesdatta/brand-equity-journal-of-marketing), [spotify-playlist-clustering](https://github.com/hannesdatta/spotify-playlist-clustering), [this class](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep)
- Automate pipelines
  - Create portable, automated, reproducible data pipelines
  - Examples: [text mining pipeline](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/practice/pipeline-automation), [project templates](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/examples/reproducible-workflow-airbnb/)

## Course framework

![Course framework](dprep_framework.png)

---

## Course structure I: Lectures and web clips

- provide __theory and context__...
- in the form of 
  - lectures, 
  - recorded webclips, and 
  - a *new* book (&rarr; [https://dprep-book.hannesdatta.com](https://dprep-book.hannesdatta.com)) (new chapters will be published during the course)

<br>
key responsibility: __Hannes Datta__

---

## Course structure II: Tutorials

- Four **key** tutorials:
  - Explore data with RMarkdown & plotting with `gagplot2`
  - Collaborate with GitHub  
  - Prepare datasets  
  - Automate workflows with `make`
- Plus Datacamp + Software Carpentry modules
- Structure of each tutorial
  - overview of "important topics"
  - discussion how to solve and accompanying you to learn coding to solve questions
  - solutions posted after tutorials

<br> 
Key responsibility: __Javier Torralba Flores__

---

## Course structure III: Team project

- implementing everything you've learnt in __a research project__ (raw data → data prep → analysis → report)
  - Data: Yelp or IMDb
  - Teams: 4- (max!)-5 students (mix expertise), __register on Canvas__ by next week
- Coaching sessions
  - Teams meet on campus during *scheduled hours*
  - Last 2 weeks of the course: *online* feedback in breakout rooms
  - Coach: first 45m check-in with each team, then supports teams individually
- Evaluation:  
  - standardized evaluation rubric on Canvas
  - self- & peer assessment to up/downweigh grades, depending on individual contribution

<br>
Key responsibility: __Roshini Sudhaharan__

---

## Assessment

- Computer exam (60%, 120 minutes) → on campus, no internet  
  - Mix of open + closed questions  
  - Example questions will be shared on Canvas; exam Q&A in week 6 and week 7
- Team project (40%) → via GitHub, self- and peer assessment  


## Tips & tricks

- Familiarize yourself with this course (e.g., syllabus) on Canvas
- Early weeks are toughest, but skills build quickly
- Stick with the same group, mix skill levels
- Collaborate and help each other
- Recall that coding can be frustrating & tiring (take breaks, get our support - DO NOT just rely on ChatGPT) &rarr; quick feedback loops in the first weeks
