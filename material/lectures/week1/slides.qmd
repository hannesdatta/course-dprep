## Welcome to dPrep!

We're about to start with the first lecture of this class.

If you haven't done so, please:

- explore the **course page** at [https://dprep.hannesdatta.com](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com)
- complete the [**software installation**](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/modules/prep/)
- my slides are available here: [week 1 slides](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/modules/week1)

<!--
- drafted this course for a very long time
- finally got the chance to teaching it now
- what is it about: radical change in the way to work on data-intensive projects
- anything you've learnt so far is about stats, or substantive areas, not about HOW to work on projects
- happy to share that vision, and share practical tips
-->

## Agenda

- Part 1 (10.45–11.45)
  - Meeting each other!
  - Motivation for the course
  - Course framework and learning goals
  - Agenda and practical arrangements

## Getting to know your programming skills...

::: incremental
- Who’s ever used R? (Share your wildest R moment!)
- Ever wrangled with messy data? How did you clean it? Did you team up or go solo?
- Imagine your dream job — what’s it going to be?
:::

---

## Motivation for course (I)

- Did my PhD in quantitative marketing
- Coded a lot (data prep, modeling), but didn’t *learn how to structure my work*
- Created a [complete chaos](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/Automation/Workflows/Starting/principles-of-project-setup-and-workflow-management/structure_phd_2013) (but still [got published](https://doi.org/10.1509%2Fjmr.12.0160))

---

## Motivation for course (II)

- Couldn’t find code that prepped the dataset
- Couldn’t find code of the econometric model that eventually got published

---

## What was so bad about it?

- **Replicability**  
  Couldn’t replicate results later
- **Reproducibility**  
  Peers couldn’t understand/implement my workflow
- **Efficiency**  
  - Changes required rerunning everything from scratch  
  - Years later, a colleague asked for data → it wasn’t documented

---

## Why should you care?

- You will soon work on data-intensive projects — thesis, internship, business
- You will change code *continuously*
- Team members/colleagues need to read and reuse your code
- Learning “good practices” takes time, but…  
- Even small **efficiency** gains pay off quickly

---

## What’s efficient?

::: incremental
- Prototype the “final pipeline” early, refine later
- Reduce setup costs when returning to a project
- Catch coding mistakes faster
- Collaborate by rotating tasks
- Share/reuse code (e.g., via packages)
- Get feedback from others
:::

---

## What’s not efficient?

::: incremental
- Waiting (for results or data prep)
- Getting distracted while waiting
- Forgetting how things were done (and why)
- Losing data
- Using undocumented code
- Becoming frustrated, feeling lost
:::

---

## Course objectives (I): Develop coding skills

1. Use R to clean and transform data for analysis  
   → e.g., [tidyverse/dplyr tutorial](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/modules/week4/tutorial/tutorial.html)

2. Use R for reports and apps  
   - Write reports in [RMarkdown](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/modules/week3/tutorial/intro-to-r.html)  
   - Build [Shiny apps](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/try/shiny-app)

---

## Course objectives (II): Collaborate on projects (GitHub)

1. Collaborate on code/projects  
   - Example: [issues page](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website/issues)

2. Document with unlimited version history  
   - Roll back, clean up freely

Examples:  
- [brand-equity-journal-of-marketing](https://github.com/hannesdatta/brand-equity-journal-of-marketing)  
- [spotify-playlist-clustering](https://github.com/hannesdatta/spotify-playlist-clustering)  
- [this class](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep)

---

## Course objectives (III): Automate pipelines

- Create portable, automated, reproducible data pipelines

Examples:  
- [text mining pipeline](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/practice/pipeline-automation)  
- [project templates](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/examples/reproducible-workflow-airbnb/)

---

## Tips & tricks

- Familiarize yourself with course site (Canvas only for admin stuff)
- Early weeks are toughest, but skills build quickly
- Stick with the same group, mix skill levels
- Collaborate and help each other

---

## Course structure

- **Skill building (weeks 1–5):**  
  - Tutorials (Hannes), coaching (Roshini), self-study
- **Project phase (weeks 2–7):**  
  - Apply skills in a team project  
  - Build custom pipelines using blocks/snippets

---

- Public & open
- Canvas only for:
  - announcements

  - project submissions  

---

## Project

- Build a **research pipeline**: download → prep → analyze → report
- Data: Yelp + IMDb (see [course page](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/project/data/))
- Teams: 5 people (mix expertise), register by next week
- Evaluation:  
  - self- & peer assessment  
  - rubric on course site

---

## Project coaching

- Teams meet on campus during scheduled hours
- Last 2 weeks: online feedback in breakout rooms
- Coach (Roshini): first 45m check-in, then supports teams individually

---

## Tutorials

- Four **key** tutorials:
  - Explore data with RMarkdown  
  - Collaborate with GitHub  
  - Prepare datasets  
  - Automate workflows with `make`
- Plus Datacamp + Software Carpentry modules

---

## Grading

- Team project (40%) → via GitHub, peer assessment  
- Computer exam (60%) → on campus, no internet  
  - Mix of open + closed questions  
  - [Preview + examples](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/exam) available

---

## Brain-dead by coding

- Coding can be frustrating, tiring
- Take breaks, run, reset
- Learn from mistakes
- Use cheat sheets + support section  
→ Quick feedback loops in the first weeks

---

## Getting support

- Course chatbot: [dprep.tilburgai.nl](https://dprep.tilburgai.nl)  
- WhatsApp (fastest): +31 13 466 8938  
- Email (slower)
