# Preview of efficient workflows

## Reproducibility & transparency

- Running [text mining tutorial](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorial) on TSH

- Why is it useful?
    - Runs with one command (`make`)
    - Template to kickstart your projects
    - Endless possibilities to extend

__What "standard workflow" templates would be useful in your area?__

## A bird eye's view

- What is it about?
    - Build entire pipeline first
    - Then refine steps

- Good for
    - quick prototype
    - swapping/upgrading modules
    - focus on the "big" picture

## Portability across computers, operating systems

- What is it about?
    - Prototype on Mac and Windows
    - Move to Linux Cloud

- Good for
    - performance issues
    - collaboration

## Branching out

- What is it about?
    - Take a "copy" of your project
    - Do changes there, test those without breaking the main project

- Good for
    - Testing
    - Robustness checks
    - Going back in time

## Time capsule

- What is it about?
    - Use version history on Git to view code (from the past)

- Good for
    - Because you *can*, you delete code and keep your project clean
    - Finding code that you want to use again
    - Search code *across* projects

## Software agility

- What is it about?
    - Use automation to connect different programs (e.g., R, Python, ...)
    - Use outputs of one as inputs of another

- Good for
    - Use a program what it's best for (e.g., R for data preparation, Python for ML)
    - Extreme flexibility
