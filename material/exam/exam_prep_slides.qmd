# Preparing for the Exam

## Familiarize yourself with TestVision

- Take the **technical practice exam** (access via [https://tiu.nu/testvision](https://tiu.nu/testvision))
  - learn how to upload & download files
  - understand how to unzip repositories, and rezip them for file submission
  - see how to fill in answers into text boxes and view the word count
  - get a general understanding of how TestVision works
- Additional resources
  - Explore [TestVision’s generic practice exam](https://oefentoetsen.testvision.nl/online/fe/login_ot.htm?campagne=tlb_demo_eng&taal=2).
  - Review [Tilburg University’s TestVision resources](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/exams/e-assessment/testvision).

## Technical Tips

- **Exam environment**:
  - Practice using **Windows**, RStudio, and the command prompt (__not__ PowerShell; ideally Anaconda Prompt, sometimes GitBash).
- **File management**:
  - Organize files by question in local folders (e.g., `C:\Users\<YOUR-U-NUMBER>\Downloads`).
  - Know how to load `.RData` files (`load('downloaded_data.RData')`).
  - Zip entire Git repositories before uploading.
- **Code management**:
  - Set working directories in RStudio via `Session → Set Working Directory → To Source File Location`.
  - Revise code for clean (top-down!) execution. No useless code.


## Cheatsheets

- **Official cheatsheets** for R, make, and Git will be provided during the exam (view [previous year's cheatsheets](https://github.
com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/raw/main/material/exam/cheatsheets/cheatsheets-exam.
zip))
- **Collective cheatsheet**
  - Drafted collaboratively in Google Docs, reviewed by the instructor, and shared as PDF.
  - [Link to the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ufyP0bcndNBltN6efJ87HdI0nthpgMQVSS-Flyr-zpU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Deadline to make your changes: 10 October 2025, 1pm.
  - I will review the document, make changes where required, and add it to the Cheatsheets.

## TestVision’s Introduction Page

- Every exam begins with an **introduction/cover page** containing official instructions.
- I will show you example cover pages now...
- Review in advance: The cover page will be available on Canvas before the exam

## Ideas for Developing Your Proficiency

- Work through the example questions and tutorials.
- Download data and create own "engineering" questions using common data operations from tutorial #3.
- Share (public) links to your teams’ GitHub repositories & fork and clone them.
  - `make`: run workflows with `make` (using the README); does it run? if not, can you fix the `makefile`?
  - Git/GitHub: work on someone else’s project (new feature branch, improve code, commit to your fork, and make a PR); *receiving teams*: review contributions and integrate PRs.

Above all, see this exam preparation *not* just as exam study, but as a way to strengthen and share your skills.
