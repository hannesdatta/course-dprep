## Overview

This is a summary of the most important Git commands.


## Code

Makes a clone of the repository at the specified URL (never clone a repository into another repository!)

```
git clone <URL>
```

---

Adds changes to the specified file to the staging area to be committed

```
git add <file_name>
```

---

Commits staged changes and allows you to write a commit message
```
git commit -m <your_message>
```

---

Pushes local changes to the specified branch of the online repository
```
git push origin <branch_name>
```

## Advanced use cases

### Add all files that have been changed

To add all files that have been changed to the staging area (to eventually commit them), use

```bash
git add .
```

That way, you don't have to mention files individually.

### Ignore files

You can create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your repository to tell Git to stop paying attention to files you donâ€™t care about.

For example, the following file will ignore any file within the my_passwords folder, as well as any csv-files (even if you call `git add .`)!

  ```
  my_passwords/*
  *.csv
  ```
