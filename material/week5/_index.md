# Week 5: Pipeline Building and Automation


## Learning goals
* Learn how to organize your project with a coherent directory structure
* Conceive your project as a pipeline
* Separate your code into smaller chunks (each one with inputs, transformations and outputs)
* Automate workflows and make them reproducible using `make`
