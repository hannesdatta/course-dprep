# Notes for pitch


Hi all,

What a week it has been! Probably you felt as exhausted as me. A first course week can be challenging. Some of you even had just started their education at Tilburg University!

In any case, the snow this weekend helped me relax a little bit, and I hope you could do the same.

You're now starting with your second course week in Data Preparation and Workflow Management.

Let's briefly recap: last week, you discovered R as a tool to explore datasets you've never seen before. You learned how to read those datasets into your computer's memory and then started to summarize the data in RMarkdowns. I really like RMarkdowns, as they look and feel nice but still allow you to work with code so you can always reproduce your results later.

The focus of this second course week is to build your data preparation skills. You may rightly wonder: wait - didn't I do this last week? Well, last week, you've only looked at raw data! This week, you're going to take the raw data and convert it into a dataset that you can actually analyze later.

For example, in my research on Spotify, I obtained data that listed, for every user, the songs they listened to, including the exact time stamps of when that happened. That's the raw data. However, for analysis, I needed to aggregate that data at the weekly level. So instead of seeing user, A listened to song B on the 1st of January at one a clock, I needed to *count all the songs user A has listened* in the first week of January. That difference sounds subtle, but it *is* super important. I typically refer to this data as a "derived" data set, as it is derived from the raw data. Sometimes, I also like to call it "cleaned", or "precleaned" data.

You're going to discover a lot of ways in which to prepare data for analysis. And the tutorial on Data Preparation in R is probably the biggest task for you to work on this week.

On top of it, you're going to study an article on Marketing Analytics for Data-Rich Environments. The article was written by two colleagues who work at the University of Maryland. It introduces you to the world of marketing and how we actually became a data-driven discipline. You'll learn, among others, about the various types of data that are available to us: what really is the difference between structured and unstructured data? What data is needed to conduct marketing-mix modeling? And which data can be used to conduct research on personalization or security and privacy issues?

In starting this week, remember to use the support chat on WhatsApp! I’m open to chat between 9 and 5 every weekday, except Thursdays. You can text me also outside of my working hours. If your question becomes outdated, just delete it from the chat so I don’t have to take a look at it when I return to my desk during regular working hours.

Finally, please keep an eye on the course page and Canvas for updates.


I look forward to seeing you on Friday!
