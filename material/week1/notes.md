# Notes for live stream

Dear students,

you're about to start with your first course week of "Data Preparation and Workflow Management".

It's probably quite exciting for you to embark on this journey, but rest assured - I'll do my best to guide you well.

If you haven't done so, you definitely need to get your R skills up-to-date. That entails following a course at Datacamp, and the link is on our course website. If you can't access all of its content and are asked to pay, send an email to our library support team to get you signed up for premium account for free.

Another thing that I consider super important for you to check out is the recording of the opening live stream. In case you can't find the link on this site, check the course's Canvas page after logging in with your Tilburg University email address.

Our goal in this first course week is for you to obtain a better understanding for the data that you're planning on using in a project. That entails some conceptual understanding about what data is important to have in a project, and some practical skills in exploring that data.

That's why I've first selected a really good reading, written by my colleague Carl Mela at Duke University. In his work, Carl shares some experience on selecting and procuring data for academic research projects. What really is the necessary data for a research project? How do you find the right contact in a firm to supply you with the data? And how to check data for completeness once it has been delivered?

The tips that are shared are extremely valuable, and I truly wish I had known them when I was working on my first research project. To top it all, the article is also quite short and to the point, so it's super gentle to read. By the way, if you hit a paywall when accessing the article, make sure you're signed on to Tilburg University's VPN.

The second - and probably biggest - thing this week is for you to work through your first tutorial. It's meant to teach you the steps required to explore a data set that you've never seen before. The really cool thing is that after fiddling around with R a while, you can *actually* produce a really good looking overview document, rendered as an HTML website, or as PDF that you can easily attach to an email and share with other students. Try to see the bigger picture here: already in week 1 of this course, you're able to explore data a bit, and share the results of your exploration with others. Continuing with the data challenge of this week, you can submit to us your own assessment of the quality of the data, and generate some interesting insights that we can further discuss in the live stream of this week.

Talking about the live stream: it's really essential that you participate actively in it. So turn on your cameras, do a bit of preparation like having a list of questions to ask, and then just enjoy the interaction with me as your coach, and your fellow students.

I really look forward seeing you on my next stream!
